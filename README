Current the path tracer give a real-time feedback via an OpenGL window. The 
tracer can be exited at any time by hitting 'esc' and the image will automatically
be saved 

Controls
w/a/s/d - left/right up/down movement
q/e - zoom in/out
i/j/k/l - camera rotations

Current implemented features are:
 * Real-time visual of path tracing (which by have automatic anti-aliasing)
 * Area Lights and Triangles 
 * Textures
 * Reflections and refractions
 * Soft shadows
 * Linear Velocities on objects 
 * BVH that gets created and updated in parallel 
 * Blur and median filter

Flags supported are:
   [width]    (optional) image width
   [height]   (optional) image height 

   -I [file]  Specify input file
   -O [file]  (optional) Specify output file, default is 'sample.tga'

   -d         Specify the depth that each ray is traced
              (Default is 6)

   -s         static - use this if there are no moving objects in the scene (the BVH updates will be skipped) 

   -n         number of passes done per frame (default is 1)

   -t         number of seconds passed per frame (this only applies if there are objects with velocity

   -e         exposure time - switches the ray tracer to polaroid mode and the picture develops over a span of time

   -v         Trippy motion blur mode

   -b         Blur the screen

   -m         Apply a median filter to the screen
