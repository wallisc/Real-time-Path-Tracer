Current the path tracer give a real-time feedback via an OpenGL window. The 
tracer can be exited at any time by hitting 'q' and the image will automatically
be saved 

Current implemented features are:
 * Real-time visual of path tracing (which by have automatic anti-aliasing)
 * Point lights, spheres, boxes, infinite planes, triangles, and smooth_triangles
 * Phong Shading and Cook-Torrance shading
 * Reflections and refractions
 * Shadows
 * BVH that gets created in parallel 

Flags supported are:
   [width]    (optional) image width
   [height]   (optional) image height 

   -I [file]  Specify input file
   -O [file]  (optional) Specify output file 

   -d         Specify the depth that each ray is traced
              (Default is 5)
